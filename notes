In order to convert ec2 deployer to docker deployer we need 3 dockers :
1- backend docker container that will replace the ec2.
2- frontend docker container that will replace the ELB.
3- DB docker container .

so to do that we need to follow below steps:

1-clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
2-run ./mvnw package command .
3-create Dockerfile for the backend (app will run on it)
4-create nginx config file to use as loadbalancer.(we chose to use the official image of nginx or to create custom docker file)
5-create docker-compose.yml and update it to include the petclinic app, nginx and the mysql.
(we can use the official mysql image in the docker-compose.
6-to run the app we need to run the command docker-compose up and then go to UPSTREAM NAME:PORT CONFIGURED should find the petclinic app .
